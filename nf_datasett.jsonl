Second, in some instances, cover crops are allopathic to weeds, meaning they produce biochemicals that are toxic or inhibitory to weed growth, thus actively killing them. Regarding Soil Solarisation, the process of heating the moist soil surface using plastic sheets accumulates solar radiation, which increases the surface soil temperature by 8\u00b0C to 12\u00b0C when the ambient summer temperature is already above 40\u00b0C."}]}

This protection occurs when organic matter, such as decomposed plant residues, becomes encapsulated within the aggregates. This structural arrangement shields the carbon from rapid microbial degradation, as the aggregate structure physically limits the access of microbes to the organic matter contained within. Specifically, microaggregates, which form inside macroaggregates, provide a crucial physical barrier. As a result, this encapsulated carbon is more stable and mineralizes slowly over an extended time frame.\n\nConventional tillage is detrimental because it disrupts the natural aggregation of soil particles, particularly in the surface layers. This disruption significantly increases aeration in the soil, which makes the organic matter more accessible to soil microbes.
